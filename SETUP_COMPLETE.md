- Add a <body> section
- Add an <h1> heading inside the body with your name

Hint: Every HTML document starts with <!DOCTYPE html>
```

**Auto-grading tests:**
1. Check for `<html>` tag (5 points)
2. Check for `<head>` tag (5 points)
3. Check for `<title>` in head (3 points)
4. Check for `<body>` tag (5 points)
